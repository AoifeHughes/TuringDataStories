# Desert Island Discs
As the iconic BBC radio programme turns 80, we explore notable people and the music that tells the stories of their lives.

As stated in the main directory README, the Turing Data Stories are published via fastpages and can be checked out [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/TuringDataStories-fastpages/).
Alternatively users can run the stories run locally:

- `cd` to the `tds-DID` directory.

- Create the `conda` virtual environment:
  ```
  conda env create
  ```

- Activate the environment:
  ```
  conda activate tds-did
  ```

- Start the notebook:
  ```
  jupyter-notebook Desert_Island_Disks.ipynb
  ```
