 We're excited you're here and want to contribute.

 We hope that these guidelines make it as easy as possible to get involved.
 If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TuringDataStories/issues).

 We welcome all contributions from documentation to testing to writing code.
 Don't let trying to be perfect get in the way of being good - exciting ideas are more important than perfect pull requests.
