# TuringDataStories

Our goal at _TuringDataStories_ is to produce educational data science content through the story telling medium. 

Our content will be split into different _Story Packages_, which begin with an interesting and relevant hypothesis and walks the user through the entire data science process - from gathering and cleaning the data, to using it for data analysis.

Our hope is that through these stories, readers will be motivated by the explanatory power of data science techniques, but also feel enabled to try it out themselves.

### About the project

This project was initially formed by a desire to contribute and advance to the analysis of government Covid-19 data.

As part of this process we recognised that government reporting of Covid-19 data was not always in the most accessible format. We also recognised that especially during these times, many invididuals may be interested in developing their technical skills in an impactful way, but not know where to start.

Our goal was therefore to help provide educational data science content that would guide the user through the process of making the data accessible, to using the data for analysis.

We hope that by using the story telling medium, we can bring people along the data science journey and showcase how these techniques can answer both fascinating and very much relevant societal questions. 

### The team

The team is currently composed of four members:
