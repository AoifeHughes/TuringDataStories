# Story description 

**Please provide a high level description of the Turing Data Story**
A clear and concise description of what the data story is going to be about.

**Which datasets will you be using in this Turing Data Story?**
Cite the dataset that are going to be used in this story (these of course can change whilst developing the story).

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the story here.


# Ethical guideline 

Ideally a Turing Data Story has these properties and follows the [5 safes framework](http://blog.ukdataservice.ac.uk/access-to-sensitive-data-for-research-the-5-safes/).

- [ ] The analysis you produce is openly available and reproducible.
- [ ] Any data used are [open](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) and have an explicit licence, provenance and attribution.
- [ ] Any data used are not [personal data](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/what-is-personal-data/) (i.e. the data is anonymous or anonymised).
- [ ] Any linkage of datasets in your data story does not lead to an increased risk of the personal identification of individuals.
- [ ] The Story must be truthful and clear about limitations of analysis (and potential biases in data).
- [ ] The Story will not lead to negative social outcomes, such as increasing discrimination, injustice.
